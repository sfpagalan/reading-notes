1. Do you agree or disagree with these articles? What stuck out to you specifically from each article?

- From the first article on privacy and personal information, it is noteworthy that `â€‹computing professionals` should strive to protect personal information and only use it for legitimate purposes, without violating the rights of individuals.
- They should establish transparent policies that allow individuals to understand what data is being collected and how it is being used.
- The article also emphasizes the need to collect only the minimum amount of personal information necessary and define clear retention and disposal periods for that information. When merging data collections, special care should be taken to protect privacy.
- From the second article on professional responsibilities, there are two key points. Firstly, computing professionals should strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of their work, respecting the dignity of all those affected.
- They should also consider the potential negative consequences of poor quality work and resist any inducements to neglect this responsibility.
- Secondly, professionals should maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice. This includes continuously upgrading skills, keeping up with the social context of their work, and adhering to existing laws, regulations, and policies.
- Lastly, the third article highlights the responsibility of organizations and groups whose systems become integrated into society's infrastructure.
- Leaders of such systems have the added responsibility to be good stewards and establish fair system access policies.
- They should also monitor the level of integration and continually assess the ethical responsibilities associated with it as society's use of the system evolves.
