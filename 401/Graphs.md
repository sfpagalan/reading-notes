1. Graph:
    A data structure consisting of a set of vertices (nodes) connected by edges.
2. Directed Graph:
    A graph in which edges have a specific direction or flow.
3. Undirected Graph:
    A graph in which edges have no specified direction.
4. Vertex:
    Also known as a node, it represents a point or element in a graph.
5. Edge:
    The connection or relationship between two vertices in a graph.
6. Weighted Graph:
    A graph where edges have associated weights or values.
7. Degree:
    The number of edges connected to a vertex in a graph.
8. Path:
    A sequence of vertices connected by edges in a graph.
9. Cycle:
    A path in a graph that starts and ends at the same vertex.
10. Connected Graph:
    A graph where there is a path between every pair of vertices.
11. Disconnected Graph:
    A graph where there are vertices that are not connected to any other vertices.
12. Complete Graph:
    A graph in which every pair of vertices is directly connected by an edge.
