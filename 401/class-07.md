# Read 7: Bearer Authorization

## Intro to JWT
[Source](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

1. What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?

- JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

2. When should we use JSON Web Tokens?

- Authorization: Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.
- Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties.

3. Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?

- Header
- Payload
- Signature

## Are JWTs Secure?

1. If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?

- The security of JWTs relies on the confidentiality of the keys used to create the signature and the ability to verify the signature to ensure the JWT hasn't been tampered with.

2. If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, it’s appended in the signature.

- To send and receive JWTs securely, both the sender (issuer) and the receiver need to know a shared secret (in the case of HMAC-based JWTs) or have access to the public key (in the case of RSA or ECDSA-based JWTs), depending on the signing algorithm used.

3. Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.

- Instructions
- Delivery

1. Why use JWT?

- `​JWT` is used because it provides a secure and efficient way to transfer information between two entities, such as a `​client` and a ​`server`, in ​`web applications`.

2. JWT is Compact and self-contained. Describe how this is useful to a non-technical friend.

- JWT being compact means that it is small in size, making it fast and easy to transmit over the `​internet`. Being self-contained means that it contains all the necessary information within the token itself, so there is no need for additional database queries. This saves time and resources by reducing the need for multiple network requests.

3. What are the three components (the structure) of a JWT signature?

- The three components of a JWT signature are the header, the payload, and the signature itself. The header specifies the algorithm and token type. The payload contains user details and other metadata. The signature is generated by combining the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret key, and it ensures the integrity of the token during transmission.
