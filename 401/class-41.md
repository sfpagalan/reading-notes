# Read 41: React Native

## getting started with react native

[Source](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

1. Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.

- Native Components, UI components, and APIs. Native Components allow developers to build parts of the app using native code, UI components provide building blocks for the user interface, and APIs facilitate interaction with native platform features.

2. What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?

- React Native solves the problem of creating mobile apps that have a native look and feel across different platforms (such as ​Android and ​iOS), hence the term "native." It allows developers to use a single codebase to build applications for multiple platforms.

3. What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?

- The building blocks of a React Native app include Native Components, UI components, and APIs. This differs from React apps, which primarily rely on components to manage the UI and state. React Native integrates with native platform components to create a more native user experience, whereas React apps are designed for web interfaces.

## expo

1. What solution does expo provide?

- Expo provides a full ecosystem of tools to help developers write, build, update, submit, and monitor mobile apps across ​Android and ​iOS with ​JavaScript.

2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.

- Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the go-to workflow.

3. What is the difference between React Native and Expo?

- The main difference between ​React Native and Expo is that Expo is a full ecosystem of tools and services built around React Native, providing additional development and deployment capabilities, while React Native is a popular framework for building native applications using JavaScript.

## expo snack

1. Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?

- Expo Snack is a nifty tool that lets us write, run, and share code for React Native applications directly in our web browser.

## ejecting

[Source](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/glossary/#eject?redirected)

1. What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?

- "Eject" refers to the process of leaving the standard Expo development environment in order to gain full control over native ​Android and ​iOS projects.

2. When should you not eject?

- When we need to stay within the standard Expo development environment and do not need full control over native projects.

3. Why might you choose to eject?

- When needing full control over your native Android and iOS projects while still being able to use Expo APIs.
