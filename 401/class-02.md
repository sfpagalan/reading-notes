# Read 2: Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## An introduction to NodeJS and Express

[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

- ​Middleware, in the context of web development, refers to a set of functions that are executed in a particular order during the processing of a request in an ​Express application. It acts as a bridge between the server and the application, allowing us to perform various tasks such as handling requests, modifying data, authenticating users, and logging.

2. Express the most popular __ __ ____.

- framework

3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

- it means that Express does not impose a specific way or structure for building web applications.
- gives developers the freedom to choose the best tools and approaches that suit their specific needs and preferences.

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

- a module is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates specific functionality. It is essentially a file that contains reusable functions, objects, or classes that can be imported and used in other parts of an application.

## What is NPM?

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

- 10.1.0

2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

- `npm install jshint --save`

## What is TDD?

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

- Tests are important because they help ensure that the program or software we create works as intended.
- Tests are like checklist or a way to double check our work.

2. What are three expected benefits of testing

- Reduced Defects
- Increaced Efficiency
- Improved Design

3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

- Partial Adoption
- Poor Maintenance of the test suits

## CI/CD

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

- Early detection of integration issues and bugs.
- Faster feedback and collaboration among team members.
- Increased software quality and stability.

2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

- Continuous Delivery ensures that the software can be released to production at any time, but it requires a manual trigger for the actual release.
- Continuous Deployment automates the release process, allowing the software to be deployed to production automatically once all tests pass.

3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

- ​GitHub fits into this process by providing a platform for source code management and collaboration. It allows team members to share and integrate their code changes seamlessly.
