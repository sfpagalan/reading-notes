Bias is like having a secret stash of favorite snacks at work.

When hungry, we tend to grab those snacks without thinking twice. Similarly, bias makes us lean towards certain people because of our own experiences and ideas.

It's like always teaming up with that one coworker you really like, even when there are other awesome teammates available.

But the thing is, this set up might not be because they're the best match, but simply because we got a soft spot for their style.

And just like those tempting snacks might not be the healthiest choice, bias isn't all that great for a workplace. It could mean we miss out on awesome ideas from others or don't give everyone a fair chance.
