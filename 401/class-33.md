[Source](https://www.digitalguardian.com/blog/what-role-based-access-control-rbac-examples-benefits-and-more)

1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

- ​Role-Based Access Control (​RBAC) is a method of access control that restricts ​network access based on an ​individual's role within an ​organization. It ensures that employees only have access to the information necessary for their job responsibilities.

2. Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

- In RBAC, roles and access permissions are assigned to users. For example, an administrator role may have all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) permissions for sensitive data and important applications, while an end-user role may only have Read access. Different roles can have different levels of access based on the organization's requirements.

3. What are the Benefits of RBAC?

- The benefits of RBAC include reducing administrative work and IT support by streamlining access management, maximizing operational efficiency by aligning roles with the organizational structure, and improving compliance with privacy and confidentiality regulations by managing data access and usage. RBAC also helps integrate third-party users into the network by assigning predefined roles.
