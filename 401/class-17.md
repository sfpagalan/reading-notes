- `Serverless` computing is like being a pirate in the `One Piece world`. When you're a pirate, you're the captain of your ship, and you're focused on finding the `One Piece treasure`. You don't want to be bothered with all the details of ship maintenance, navigation, and crew management. Instead, you invite the services of a trustworthy `shipwright` like `Franky` and `navigator` like `Nami`, who take care of all the technical aspects of sailing.

- CDNs work with website visitors by redirecting their requests to the closest server within the CDN network. When a user requests a webpage, the CDN identifies the geographically nearest server and delivers the cached content from that server. This reduces latency and improves page loading times for the visitor.

3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?
