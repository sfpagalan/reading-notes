## Socket.io Chat Example

[Source](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/)

1. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.

- The Chat Example is a simple web application that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. It is built using Node.js and Socket.IO. The application consists of a web page where users can type messages and send them to the server. The server then broadcasts these messages to all connected clients, enabling real-time communication. It demonstrates the concept of using sockets to establish bi-directional communication between clients and servers.

2. What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?

- Getting a proof of life on the backend by listening for the 'connection' event. When a user connects to the chat application, the server logs a message indicating that a user has connected. Similarly, when a user disconnects, the server logs another message. These messages serve as proof that the backend is functioning and interacting with connected clients.

3. Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?

- If we want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket, we can use the broadcast flag. By calling socket.broadcast.emit(), we can emit an event and send the message to all other connected sockets except for the socket that initiated the emission. This way, the message is broadcasted to all clients except for the sender.

## Rooms

[Source](https://socket.io/docs/v4/rooms)

1. What is a room and how might a room be useful?

- A room in Socket.IO is a server-only channel where sockets can join and leave. It is useful for broadcasting events to a specific subset of clients. Rooms allow you to group sockets together based on certain criteria, such as user ID or entity ID, and send targeted events to those sockets.

2. How do you join a room?

- To join a room, you can call the join method on a socket instance and provide the name or identifier of the room you want to join. For example: socket.join("roomName"). This will subscribe the socket to the specified room, allowing it to receive events targeted to that room.

3. how do you leave a room?

- To leave a room, you can call the leave method on a socket instance and provide the name or identifier of the room you want to leave. For example: socket.leave("roomName"). This will unsubscribe the socket from the specified room, preventing it from receiving events targeted to that room.

## Namespaces

[Source](https://socket.io/docs/v4/namespaces/)

1. What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?

- A ​namespace in ​Socket.io is a ​communication channel that allows you to split the ​logic of your ​application over a single shared connection. It enables you to create separate channels for different parts of your application or specific groups of users.

2. Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)

- Each namespace potentially has its own event handlers, rooms, and middlewares. Event handlers define how the namespace handles incoming events, rooms allow you to group sockets together for targeted communication, and middlewares provide a way to execute logic before events are handled.

3. Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces

- An example use case for separate namespaces is when you have multiple tenants in your application and you want to dynamically create one namespace per tenant. This allows you to isolate and manage the communication and logic specific to each tenant separately. It provides better control and organization in a multi-tenant environment.
