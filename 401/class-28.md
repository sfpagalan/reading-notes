## useEffect hook

[Source](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#reference)

1. What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?

- The useEffect hook in React is mainly used to sync your component with outside systems, like the internet or your browser's tools. It lets you do extra tasks, like grabbing data or signing up for updates, within a basic function-based component.

2. How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?

- The effect runs when your component first appears on the screen. It watches things like properties, state, or other variables in the component. When these change, the effect runs again, keeping your component updated with any outside systems.

3. What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?

- The effect's return value is like a janitor; it tidies up when the component leaves the screen or the effect needs to run again. This helps you end subscriptions, cancel waiting tasks, and clean up other stuff to keep your app running smoothly.
