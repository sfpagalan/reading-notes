1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

- When deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem, one of the more important things to consider is the efficiency of the data structure for the given problem.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

- To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, it is crucial to implement proper termination conditions and base cases in recursive functions.
