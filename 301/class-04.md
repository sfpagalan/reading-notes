## React Docs - Forms

[Source](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- refers to a form element, like an input or textarea, whose value is controlled by the component's state.

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- recommended to update the state with the user's responses as soon as they enter them, rather than waiting until they submit the form. Because, updating the state as the user types provides a more responsive and interactive user experience.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- To target what the user is entering when you have an event handler on an input field, you can use the event object passed to the event handler function.
