1. To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?

- In my previous employment, I had to resign due to workplace harassment. My colleagues began projecting their fears and insecurities onto me, despite their baseless accusations. What started as a minor problem escalated and became unmanageable. I made a personal commitment not to tolerate disrespect from others. Eventually, the situation reached a point where my workload became overwhelming, as my coworkers started neglecting their responsibilities, leaving everything for me to handle. As a result, I lost the motivation to continue working in that environment.

2. How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?

- Creating Psychological Safety: Ensure that all team members feel safe to express their thoughts, ideas, and concerns without fear of reprimand or punishment. Create an inclusive and supportive environment that encourages collaboration and values diverse perspectives.

## How I explained REST to my brother

[Source](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

- He contributed to the creation of the first web servers and conducted research that explained the fundamental principles behind how the web works. 

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- The techniques mentioned in the article that are taught in the class are not suitable for talking to all machines in the world because they were not originally designed with such broad communication in mind.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- The HTTP protocol is a set of rules and conventions that govern the communication between web servers and web clients (browsers). 

4. What does a GET do?

- GET request is a method used by clients (usually web browsers) to request a representation of a resource from a server. When a client issues a GET request to a specific URL, the server responds by providing the requested resource's representation. 

5. What does a POST do?

- A POST request is another HTTP method used by clients to submit data to a server. When a client sends a POST request, it typically includes data in the request body. 

6. What does PUT do?

- The PUT request is an HTTP method that clients use to update or replace an existing resource on the server. When a client sends a PUT request to a specific URL, it typically includes the updated data for the resource. 

7. What does PATCH do?

-PATCH is another HTTP method used for updating resources, similar to PUT. However, unlike PUT which typically replaces the entire resource with new data, PATCH allows clients to send only the specific changes or modifications they want to apply to the resource.
