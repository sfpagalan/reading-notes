1. What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

- RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) often follow the principles of REST and use CRUD operations to interact with resources.

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

a. Design the resource model: Identify the resources that will be exposed through the API and define their attributes and relationships.
b. Define the endpoints: Determine the URLs (endpoints) that will be used to access and manipulate the resources.
c. Choose HTTP methods: Assign appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to each endpoint based on the desired CRUD operation.
d. Implement the logic: Write the backend code to handle the requests to the different endpoints, performing the necessary CRUD operations on the resources.
e. Test and document: Test the API endpoints using suitable tools ensuring they behave as expected. Document the API, including details about the endpoints, expected inputs, and responses, to assist developers who will be integrating with the API.
