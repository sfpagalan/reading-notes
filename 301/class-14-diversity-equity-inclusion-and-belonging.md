[Source](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

- During the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science, personal computers started showing up in significant numbers in U.S. homes.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

- It matters that males had been playing on computers growing up because the marketing and narrative at that time created the perception that computers were primarily for boys. This perpetuated the stereotype that computer science was a male-dominated field, discouraging girls and women from pursuing it as a career. The assumption that students had prior computer experience disadvantaged those who did not have access to computers at home, further widening the gender gap in computer science.

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

- Diversity efforts are most successful when there is a commitment from company leaders. Meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters and actively drive the efforts.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

- Diverse companies perform better because they have smarter and more innovative teams. Studies have shown that diverse groups bring different perspectives and problem-solving abilities, leading to faster and better solutions. 

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

- An example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base is YouTube's experience. When their developer team, which was mostly right-handed, built the iOS app without considering left-handed users, a significant number of videos were uploaded upside down. This shows that without diverse representation in the team, a company may unintentionally overlook the needs and experiences of certain user groups.
