# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## Learn HTML: Ordered and Inordered lists

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

## Learn CSS: The Box Model

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

- Margin and Padding are two characters with special properties. Margin creates whitespace to separate elements, while Padding adds space around the content. When Box arrives, Margin ensures it has enough breathing room, while Padding makes its content comfortable. Together, they help elements find their perfect positions, creating harmony and balance in design.

2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

- Content Box: Area where content is displayed.
- Padding Box: Sits around the content as white space.
- Border Box: Wraps the content and any padding.
- MArgin Box: Outermost layer that wraps the content, padding, and border as a whitespace between this box and other elements.

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?
