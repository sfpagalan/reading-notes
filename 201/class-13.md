[Source](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/local-storage-and-how-to-use-it/)

1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

- Developers use local storage in web applications to store data locally on the user's browser, allowing the application to retain information even after the user leaves the page.

2. What information should not be stored in local storage?

- Local storage should not be used to store sensitive information like passwords or credit card details, as it can be accessed by JavaScript running on the same domain, potentially exposing it to security risks.

3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

- Local storage can only store data in string format. To store non-string data like objects or numbers, developers need to convert them to strings before storing.
