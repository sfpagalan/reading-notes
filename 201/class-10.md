# Read 09: Debugging

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

[What Went Wrong?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

- Syntax errors: are spelling errors in the code that causes the program to not run or stop working part way through. Will usually give some error messages.
- Logic errors: are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what it was intended to be. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- having infinite loops due to the incorrect use of while loop.
- variables not declared is the most common, either it was declared multiple times or not at all.
- one of the common errors is the wrong spelling and forgetting to put a comma or semi colon.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

- improves debugging and will help in the long term making me do a lot of problem solving and logical thinking.

## The JavaScript Debugger

[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

- Debugger allows developers to pause the execution of the code at specific points to examine the values of variable. This tool can help developers identify and fix errors and sometimes understand how the code is executed.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

- is a marker set by the developer in their code using the debugger. when the code execution reaches the breakpoint, the program pauses allowing developers to inspect the state of variables.

3. What is the call stack?

- is a data structure used by the javascript runtime to keep track of function calls during the execution of a program. this helps the computer to keep track of where it is in the program and which function it should return to after completing a task.

## Things I want to know more about

- I used a debugger before to figure out what was wrong in my javascript. this is a tool that i keep forgetting to take advantage of and would end up spending so much time wasted looking through my javascript. definately want to know more about the debugging tools to make my life easy.
