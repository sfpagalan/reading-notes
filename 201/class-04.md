- creating precise layouts.

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

- position origin. absolute positioning is relative to the containing block/ancestor/parent while fixed is relative to the initial block.

## Learn JS

[Functions-Reusable Blocks of Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

## Misc

[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

- Great efficiency: by listening the the pair and coming up with ideas, this will reduce the amount of time spent and wasted in an area where a person can get stuck on.
- Learning from fellow students: this will also be a great opportunity to share ideas and learn more as the pair tackles obstacles in their codes.

## Things I want to know more about

- As I previously mentioned in my prior class reading notes, there's so much to learn and feeling like as soon as I learn something, i'll find out that there's more to the topic the next day. As of right now, I just want to focus on learning the current topic and study more after to prevent myself from being side tracked or lose focus.
