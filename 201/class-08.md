1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

- This means that a flexbox helps in arrainging emelents either horizontally or vertically along a single line.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

- Main axis: is the primary line created in the direction along which elements are arranged. Can be horizontal(left to right) or certical (top to bottom).
- Cross axis: it is perpendicular to the main axis and intersects it at a right angle.
- In regards to web designing, the cross axis is the opposite direction of the main axis, so if the main axis is horizontal, the cross axis is vertical, and vice versa.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

- for example, if properties like 'order', 'flex-direction', or 'flex-wrap' are used incorrectly or excessively, it can disrupt the natural reading order of the content.
