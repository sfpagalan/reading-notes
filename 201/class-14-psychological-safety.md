1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

- Being able to trust your teammates in both their abilities and intentions.
- being able to speak your mind without getting repremanded or punished.
- having the confidence to speak your mind.

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

- In my previous employment, I had to resign due to workplace harassment. My colleagues began projecting their fears and insecurities onto me, despite their baseless accusations. What started as a minor problem escalated and became unmanageable. I made a personal commitment not to tolerate disrespect from others. Eventually, the situation reached a point where my workload became overwhelming, as my coworkers started neglecting their responsibilities, leaving everything for me to handle. As a result, I lost the motivation to continue working in that environment.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

- creates an environment where individuals can thrive, leading to improved performance, increased innovation, and stronger organizational culture.
